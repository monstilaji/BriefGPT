## Plot Summary
 
The novel is divided into three parts: The First Day, The Second Day, and The Third Day. Each part follows the events of a single day in the lives of the protagonists.
 
The First Day introduces us to Pietro Moroni, a 12-year-old boy who lives with his mother Grazia and his stepfather Raffaele in Ischiano Scalo, a village near a lagoon full of mosquitoes. Pietro is an outsider who loves playing with snakes and dreams of becoming a herpetologist. He has a crush on Gloria Della Rocca, a beautiful girl from a wealthy family who attends his school. Pietro also idolizes Graziano Biglia, a 35-year-old musician who used to be a famous rock star but now leads a decadent life in Ischiano Scalo. Graziano is a womanizer who seduces many women but never falls in love. He has a complicated relationship with his mother Flora, who runs a bar called The Blue Whale.
 
The Second Day focuses on the adventures of Pietro and Graziano. Pietro decides to skip school and go to The Blue Whale to meet Graziano. He hopes that Graziano will teach him how to play guitar and impress Gloria. However, things go wrong when Pietro accidentally breaks Graziano's guitar and causes a fire in the bar. Graziano decides to take Pietro with him on his motorcycle and escape from Ischiano Scalo. They embark on a road trip that takes them to various places, such as a zoo, a circus, and a castle. Along the way, they encounter many dangers and challenges, but also bond over their shared passion for music and animals.

She feels trapped in her marriage with Raffaele, who is abusive and violent. She also has a dark past that involves a kidnapping and a murder. She decides to run away from Ischiano Scalo with her son Pietro, but she doesn't know that he is already gone with Graziano. Meanwhile, Graziano falls in love with Marta Cappadoro, a young schoolteacher who works at Pietro's school. Marta is shy and innocent, but she has a strong personality and a sense of justice.
